- **Total**: ~235-450ms (20x speedup over CPU)
- **Memory overhead**: 0.8MB causal mask + 5.2MB K,V per step

### Optimization Potential Identified:

- **Memory savings**: 0.8MB per generation step
- **Scaling improvement**: Linear O(n) instead of quadratic O(n²)
- **Projected speedup**: 30-50% for longer sequences

## Next Priority: KV Cache Implementation (Phase 8)

### The Core Goal:
Transform the sequence-aware decoder from functional proof-of-concept to production-optimized system by implementing incremental KV caching while preserving the revolutionary sequence awareness capabilities.

### Current Implementation Pattern:
```python
# Current: Full sequence computation every step (inefficient)
Q_self = ops.matmul(x_norm, Q_weight)  # [1, max_seq_len, d_model] - ALL positions
K_self = ops.matmul(x_norm, K_weight)  # [1, max_seq_len, d_model] - ALL positions  
V_self = ops.matmul(x_norm, V_weight)  # [1, max_seq_len, d_model] - ALL positions
scores = ops.matmul(Q_self, K_self^T)  # [1, max_seq_len, max_seq_len] - ALL pairs
```

### Target Optimization Pattern:
```python
# Optimized: Incremental computation with KV caching (efficient)
Q_current = ops.matmul(x_norm[:, pos:pos+1], Q_weight)  # [1, 1, d_model] - current only
K_current = ops.matmul(x_norm[:, pos:pos+1], K_weight)  # [1, 1, d_model] - current only
V_current = ops.matmul(x_norm[:, pos:pos+1], V_weight)  # [1, 1, d_model] - current only

# Update cache at current position
cache_k[:, pos, :] = K_current
cache_v[:, pos, :] = V_current

# Attention: current Q vs all cached K,V
scores = ops.matmul(Q_current, cache_k[:, :pos+1, :]^T)  # [1, 1, pos+1] - linear growth
```

## Specific Tasks for Next Session:

### High Priority Implementation:
1. **Modify graph input types** to include KV cache tensors and current position
2. **Update attention computation** to use incremental K,V updates with cache slicing  
3. **Implement cache management** in generation loop with position-based updates
4. **Test performance improvements** and validate sequence coherence is maintained
5. **Benchmark optimized vs current** implementation to quantify actual improvements

### Technical Implementation Steps:
1. **Graph Architecture Changes**:
   - Add KV cache input tensors: `cache_k_type`, `cache_v_type` for each layer
   - Add position index input: `current_pos_type`
   - Modify attention layers for incremental computation
   - Output updated cache tensors

2. **Attention Pattern Updates**:
   - Compute Q,K,V only for current position
   - Update cache at current position using position indexing
   - Slice valid cache entries (0:current_pos+1)
   - Apply attention over valid cache with automatic causal masking

3. **Generation Loop Optimization**:
   - Initialize persistent KV caches for all layers
   - Pass cache state and position to graph execution
   - Extract and maintain updated cache across generation steps
   - Remove full causal mask computation (implicit from cache slicing)

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] KV cache tensors successfully integrated into MAX Graph inputs/outputs
- [ ] Incremental K,V computation working with position-based cache updates
- [ ] Performance improved beyond current ~235-450ms while maintaining quality
- [ ] Memory usage optimized with 0.8MB+ savings per generation step
- [ ] Sequence coherence and causal masking preserved through optimization
- [ ] Linear O(n) scaling demonstrated vs current quadratic O(n²)

### Key Technical Considerations:
- **Cache Tensor Management**: Efficient allocation, updates, and slicing in MAX Graph
- **Position-Based Indexing**: Proper cache updates using current position without full recomputation
- **Causal Constraint Preservation**: Ensure incremental approach maintains causal masking properties
- **Memory Efficiency**: Balance cache memory usage with computation savings
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain ability to fall back to full computation if needed

## Expected Outcome:
Transform the sequence-aware decoder into a production-ready system with:
- **Massive performance improvements** (448x K,V reduction, 25,088x attention reduction)
- **Linear scaling characteristics** instead of quadratic complexity
- **Optimized memory usage** with significant per-step savings
- **Maintained sequence awareness** and causal properties
- **Enterprise-grade performance** ready for deployment

This represents the final optimization milestone for the MAX Graph autoregressive text decoder project.
