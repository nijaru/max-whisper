## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 2: Hybrid Optimization (Current Priority)
**Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Status**: üîß IN PROGRESS
**Goal**: Achieve full-length transcription with current hybrid

#### Tasks
1. **Decoder Parameter Analysis**
   - Debug early stopping at 218 characters
   - Analyze confidence thresholds and beam search behavior
   - Compare attention patterns between MAX Graph vs OpenAI features

2. **Parameter Optimization**
   ```python
   # Current parameters
   beam_size=5, temperature=0.0, sample_len=448
   
   # Optimization targets
   beam_size: [1, 3, 5, 10]
   temperature: [0.0, 0.1, 0.3]
   max_length: [448, 1000, 2000]
   patience: [1, 5, 10]
   ```

3. **Feature Analysis**
   - Compare token probability distributions
   - Analyze why decoder confidence drops for MAX Graph features
   - Test feature normalization approaches

**Success Criteria**: 2000+ character meaningful transcription

### Phase 3: MAX Graph Feasibility Research
**Timeline**: 1 week
**Status**: üìã PLANNED
**Goal**: Assess technical feasibility of full MAX Graph decoder

#### Research Areas

1. **MAX Graph Operations Audit**
   ```python
   # Required decoder operations
   - Autoregressive text generation loops
   - Causal attention masks (triangular)
   - Token embedding lookup tables
   - Softmax + probabilistic sampling
   - Dynamic shape handling for variable sequences
   - KV caching for efficiency
   ```

2. **Technical Constraints Analysis**
   - **Dynamic Shapes**: Can MAX Graph handle variable-length sequences?
   - **Control Flow**: Support for autoregressive loops (while/for loops)?
   - **Text Operations**: Token embedding, vocabulary lookup operations?
   - **Memory Management**: Efficient KV caching and state management?

3. **Performance Modeling**
   - Estimate decoder acceleration potential
   - Compare memory usage: Full MAX Graph vs Hybrid
   - Identify potential bottlenecks

4. **Alternative Approaches**
   - **Selective Acceleration**: MAX Graph for compute-heavy ops only
   - **Mojo Integration**: Use Mojo for operations MAX Graph cannot handle
   - **Hybrid Optimization**: Perfect current approach as production solution

**Deliverables**:
- Technical feasibility report
- Implementation complexity assessment
- Performance projection analysis
- Risk mitigation strategies

### Phase 4: MAX Graph Decoder Implementation
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Status**: üöÄ FUTURE
**Goal**: Build complete MAX Graph decoder

#### Week 1: Basic Attention
```python
# Core attention mechanism in MAX Graph
def max_graph_attention(q, k, v, mask=None):
    # Scaled dot-product attention
    scores = ops.matmul(q, ops.transpose(k, -1, -2))
    scores = ops.div(scores, ops.sqrt(d_k))
    
    if mask is not None:
        scores = ops.masked_fill(scores, mask, -1e9)
    
    attn_weights = ops.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
    output = ops.matmul(attn_weights, v)
    return output
```

#### Week 2: Text Generation
```python
# Autoregressive generation loop
def max_graph_generate(encoder_features, max_length=448):
    tokens = [BOS_TOKEN]
    
    for step in range(max_length):
        # Forward pass through decoder
        logits = max_graph_decoder(tokens, encoder_features)
        
        # Sample next token
        probs = ops.softmax(logits[-1], dim=-1)
        next_token = ops.sample(probs)
        
        tokens.append(next_token)
        
        if next_token == EOS_TOKEN:
            break
    
    return tokens
```

#### Week 3: Integration & Optimization
- End-to-end pipeline integration
- Performance optimization and kernel fusion
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Memory optimization and KV caching

### Phase 5: Production Optimization
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Status**: üéØ FUTURE
**Goal**: Optimize complete pipeline for production

#### Optimization Areas
1. **Kernel Fusion**: Combine operations for reduced memory transfers
2. **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple audio files simultaneously
3. **Memory Optimization**: Efficient tensor allocation and reuse
4. **Quantization**: Model compression for faster inference

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Technical Areas

1. **Autoregressive Generation**
   - **Risk**: MAX Graph may not efficiently support dynamic control flow
   - **Mitigation**: Research alternative architectures (parallel decoding, fixed-length generation)

2. **Text Operations**
   - **Risk**: Limited text processing capabilities vs PyTorch
   - **Mitigation**: Hybrid approach keeping text operations in PyTorch/Mojo

3. **Performance Regression**
   - **Risk**: Full MAX Graph might be slower than hybrid due to overhead
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive benchmarking and selective acceleration

4. **Debugging Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Harder to debug full MAX Graph vs hybrid approach
   - **Mitigation**: Incremental development with extensive testing

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Hybrid Fallback**: Perfect current hybrid as production-ready solution
2. **Modular Design**: Build decoder components independently for easier testing
3. **Performance Gates**: Ensure each component improves performance before integration
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive validation against reference implementations

## Decision Points
