  - Updated README.md and CLAUDE.md with realistic status
  - Removed hackathon urgency language

- ‚úÖ Established clear project structure
  - Following external/modular/ patterns
  - Improved organization and clarity
  - Better separation of concerns

### Key Insights
- Project structure now follows idiomatic patterns

- Clear separation between user docs and agent tracking

## Previous Sessions Summary

### MAX Graph Integration Achievement
- ‚úÖ Complete architectural integration of MAX Graph encoder
- ‚úÖ Successful weight extraction (65 weights from Whisper tiny)
- ‚úÖ Graph compilation and execution without errors
- ‚úÖ Cross-framework integration (MAX Graph ‚Üí PyTorch)
- ‚úÖ Device management and tensor operations
- ‚úÖ Fast encoder execution (~123ms on GPU)

### Current Challenge
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Semantic quality: Encoder produces repetitive tokens instead of meaningful transcription
- Technical integration is complete, focus shifted to output quality

### Working Baselines
- ‚úÖ CPU implementation: Perfect transcription in ~10.6s
- ‚úÖ GPU implementation: Perfect transcription in ~1.9s

## 2025-07-01: Infrastructure Improvements 

### Completed Infrastructure Upgrades
- ‚úÖ **Fixed broken benchmarks** - Updated import paths in benchmark_all.py and whisper_comparison.py
- ‚úÖ **Added structured logging** - JSON output, performance tracking, error handling
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced benchmark system** - New benchmark_runner.py with proper error handling
- ‚úÖ **Converted to pixi tasks** - Replaced complex Makefile with clean pixi task definitions
- ‚úÖ **Added comprehensive tests** - Unit tests for implementations, logging, and audio processing
- ‚úÖ **Created Mojo conversion plan** - Strategic analysis of what should/shouldn't be converted

### Key New Capabilities
- **JSON output**: `pixi run -e benchmark benchmark-json`
- **Structured logging**: Proper error tracking and performance measurement
- **Better error handling**: Retries, detailed error reporting, graceful failures
- **Comprehensive testing**: Unit tests, mocking, proper test structure

### Infrastructure Quality Assessment
- **Before**: Broken benchmarks, no logging, complex Makefile, minimal tests
- **After**: Working benchmarks, structured logging, clean pixi tasks, comprehensive tests

## 2025-07-01: Semantic Quality Implementation Plan

### Strategic Planning Completed
- ‚úÖ **Created systematic debugging plan** - 3-phase approach (Analysis ‚Üí Debugging ‚Üí Validation)
- ‚úÖ **Set up task management system** - Integrated with Claude Code todos for detailed tracking
- ‚úÖ **Established debugging workflow** - Step-by-step procedures for systematic investigation
- ‚úÖ **Created documentation framework** - DEBUGGING_FINDINGS.md for tracking attempts and solutions

### 3-Phase Plan Overview
- **Phase 1: Feature Analysis** (Week 1) - Compare encoder outputs, identify divergence points
- **Phase 2: Precision Debugging** (Weeks 2-3) - Fix numerical precision issues systematically  
- **Phase 3: Validation** (Week 4) - Comprehensive testing and performance validation

### Documentation Structure Created
- `SEMANTIC_QUALITY_PLAN.md` - High-level strategic plan
- `DEBUGGING_FINDINGS.md` - Session tracking and issue documentation
- `DEBUGGING_WORKFLOW.md` - Step-by-step procedures
- Updated `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current focus and next steps

### Implementation Status Update
- **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Critical bias bug identified and fixed
- **Current Phase**: Phase 2 - Scale/variance optimization in progress
- **Next Session**: Continue systematic debugging of attention and convolution operations
- **Task Management**: Use Claude Code TodoWrite/TodoRead for specific tasks
- **Progress Tracking**: Document each session in DEBUGGING_FINDINGS.md

## Phase 1 Sessions: Feature Analysis ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Session: 2025-07-01 - Phase 1 - Critical Bug Discovery
**Duration**: Full debugging session
**Objective**: Systematically compare encoder features to identify semantic divergence
**Hypothesis**: MAX Graph encoder missing operations or has numerical precision issues

**Planned**:
- [x] Set up feature extraction infrastructure
- [x] Extract encoder features from all implementations
- [x] Create numerical comparison tools
- [x] Identify specific divergence points

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Created benchmarks/encoder_feature_debug.py for systematic feature extraction
- ‚úÖ Created benchmarks/feature_extractor.py for cross-implementation comparison
- ‚úÖ Created benchmarks/simple_feature_comparison.py for quick validation
- ‚úÖ Added pixi tasks: debug-encoder, compare-simple
- ‚úÖ Discovered missing final layer normalization (ln_post) in MAX Graph encoder
- ‚úÖ Implemented complete fix: weight extraction + graph operation + tensor execution
- ‚úÖ Verified 99% bias improvement: mean 0.692 ‚Üí 0.002

**Key Findings**: 
- **Root Cause**: Missing ln_post (final layer normalization) in MAX Graph encoder
- **Impact**: Encoder feature bias reduced from 0.692 ‚Üí 0.002 (99% improvement)
- **Output Quality**: Improved from repetitive `<|ml|>` tokens to meaningful characters
- **Remaining Issue**: Scale/variance still higher than expected (std: 1.47 vs ~0.40)

**Todos Created**: Address remaining scale/variance optimization issues
**Next Focus**: Phase 2 - Scale optimization for attention and convolution operations
