## Phase 2 Sessions: Precision Debugging & Fixes 🔧 MAJOR PROGRESS

### Session: 2025-07-02 - Phase 2 - Convolution Architecture Overhaul

  - Proper NHWC/RSCF tensor layout handling for Conv2D operations
  - Weight permutation using `ops.permute([2,1,0])` for pytorch -> MAX format
- ✅ **Fixed Attention Scaling**: Dynamic head_dim calculation instead of fixed scaling
- ✅ **Performance Improvements**: Encoder processing time reduced to ~98.5ms
- ✅ **Weight Loading**: All 67 pretrained weights loading correctly
- ✅ **Cross-Framework Integration**: Maintained MAX Graph -> PyTorch decoder pipeline

**Key Technical Changes**:
```python
# Before: Inefficient kernel averaging
x = ops.mul(ops.add(ops.add(x0, x1), x2), scale_third)

# After: Proper Conv2D with stride=2 downsampling  
x = ops.conv2d(x_2d, conv2_weight_2d, stride=(1, 2), padding=(0, 0, 1, 1))
```

**Results**:
- **Performance**: ~98.5ms encoder (13.0x speedup over CPU)
- **Bias**: Mean 0.018 (excellent, near target 0.0) 
- **Variance**: Std 1.708 (improved, but still higher than target ~0.40)
- **Compilation**: Successful with proper Conv2D operations
- **Output**: Partial improvement but semantic quality still needs work

**Key Findings**:
- **Root Cause Identified**: Kernel averaging was destroying signal characteristics
- **Architecture Success**: Proper conv operations compile and execute efficiently
