# Progress Log

## 2025-07-01: Documentation and Structure Cleanup

### Completed
- ✅ Reorganized project structure following modular patterns
  - Moved `src/model/` → `max-whisper/` (main component)
  - Moved `src/audio/` → `max-whisper/audio/`
  - Moved `src/utils/` → `max-whisper/utils/`
  - Moved `src/benchmarks/` → `benchmarks/`
  - Moved `src/demo/` → `examples/`
  - Moved `benchmark_all.py` → `benchmarks/`

- ✅ Cleaned up documentation
  - Removed 7 redundant docs files
  - Created focused `docs/agent/` directory
  - Updated README.md and CLAUDE.md with realistic status
  - Removed hackathon urgency language

- ✅ Established clear project structure
  - Following external/modular/ patterns
  - Improved organization and clarity
  - Better separation of concerns

### Key Insights
- Project structure now follows idiomatic patterns
- Documentation is cleaner and less redundant
- Clear separation between user docs and agent tracking

## Previous Sessions Summary

### MAX Graph Integration Achievement
- ✅ Complete architectural integration of MAX Graph encoder
- ✅ Successful weight extraction (65 weights from Whisper tiny)
- ✅ Graph compilation and execution without errors
- ✅ Cross-framework integration (MAX Graph → PyTorch)
- ✅ Device management and tensor operations
- ✅ Fast encoder execution (~123ms on GPU)

### Current Challenge
- ⚠️ Semantic quality: Encoder produces repetitive tokens instead of meaningful transcription
- Technical integration is complete, focus shifted to output quality

### Working Baselines
- ✅ CPU implementation: Perfect transcription in ~10.6s
- ✅ GPU implementation: Perfect transcription in ~1.9s

## 2025-07-01: Infrastructure Improvements 

### Completed Infrastructure Upgrades
- ✅ **Fixed broken benchmarks** - Updated import paths in benchmark_all.py and whisper_comparison.py
- ✅ **Added structured logging** - JSON output, performance tracking, error handling
- ✅ **Enhanced benchmark system** - New benchmark_runner.py with proper error handling
- ✅ **Converted to pixi tasks** - Replaced complex Makefile with clean pixi task definitions
- ✅ **Added comprehensive tests** - Unit tests for implementations, logging, and audio processing
- ✅ **Created Mojo conversion plan** - Strategic analysis of what should/shouldn't be converted

### Key New Capabilities
- **JSON output**: `pixi run -e benchmark benchmark-json`
- **Structured logging**: Proper error tracking and performance measurement
- **Better error handling**: Retries, detailed error reporting, graceful failures
- **Comprehensive testing**: Unit tests, mocking, proper test structure

### Infrastructure Quality Assessment
- **Before**: Broken benchmarks, no logging, complex Makefile, minimal tests
- **After**: Working benchmarks, structured logging, clean pixi tasks, comprehensive tests

## Next Session Priorities  
1. **Feature Analysis**: Compare MAX Graph vs reference encoder outputs
2. **Operation Validation**: Verify numerical precision of MAX Graph operations
3. **Investigation**: Identify root cause of semantic quality issue using new logging tools
4. **Audio Processing**: Consider implementing Mojo audio kernels for performance

## Project Status
- **Technical Foundation**: Complete ✅
- **Performance**: Competitive ✅  
- **Output Quality**: Needs improvement ⚠️
- **Documentation**: Clean and organized ✅
