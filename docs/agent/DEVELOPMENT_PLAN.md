# Development Plan

## Primary Goal
Achieve meaningful speech transcription with MAX Graph encoder while maintaining the successful architectural integration.

## Infrastructure Improvements
See [IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md](IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md) for comprehensive project infrastructure improvements including testing, benchmarking, and development experience enhancements.

## Phase 1: Diagnostic Analysis âœ… COMPLETED
**Objective**: Understand why MAX Graph encoder features lack semantic richness

### Tasks âœ… ALL COMPLETED
1. **Feature Comparison** âœ… COMPLETED
   - âœ… Extracted and compared encoder outputs from MAX Graph vs OpenAI implementations
   - âœ… Analyzed numerical differences and identified critical missing ln_post layer
   - âœ… Found where semantic information was lost (missing final layer normalization)

2. **Operation Validation** âœ… COMPLETED
   - âœ… Verified MAX Graph operations and found missing ln_post
   - âœ… Checked numerical precision and found major bias issue (0.692 vs 0.002)
   - âœ… Validated weight loading - discovered ln_post weights not extracted

3. **Pipeline Debugging** âœ… COMPLETED
   - âœ… Isolated encoder issue (bias problem in encoder features)
   - âœ… Built comprehensive debugging tools for systematic analysis
   - âœ… Validated mel spectrogram processing works correctly

**MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: Fixed critical bias issue - encoder mean reduced from 0.692 â†’ 0.002 (99% improvement)

## Phase 2: Scale Optimization ðŸ”§ IN PROGRESS
**Objective**: Achieve perfect numerical fidelity for semantic output

**Current Status**: Major bias issue fixed, now working on scale/variance optimization

### Current Focus (Scale/Variance Issues)
1. **Scale Analysis** ðŸ”§ IN PROGRESS
   - âœ… Fixed major bias issue (ln_post layer normalization)
   - ðŸ”§ Working on variance optimization (std: 1.47 vs target ~0.40)
   - ðŸ”§ Investigating why features have ~3.7x higher variance than expected

2. **Operation Precision** ðŸ”§ IN PROGRESS
   - ðŸ”§ Attention mechanism scaling investigation
   - ðŸ”§ Convolution operation precision analysis
   - ðŸ”§ Weight precision and tensor operation validation
   - ðŸ”§ Layer normalization epsilon parameter verification

3. **Architecture Refinement**
   - Compare MAX Graph operations with reference implementations
   - Implement missing operations if needed
   - Optimize computation order and precision

## Phase 3: Performance Optimization
**Objective**: Maintain fast execution while improving quality

### Future Work
- Kernel fusion optimization
- Memory usage optimization
- End-to-end pipeline performance tuning

## Success Criteria
- [ ] MAX Graph encoder produces semantically meaningful features
- [ ] Decoder generates accurate transcription (not repetitive tokens)
- [ ] Performance remains competitive with GPU version
- [ ] Clean integration without errors

## Risk Mitigation
- Maintain working CPU/GPU implementations as baselines
- Document all changes for potential rollback
- Test incrementally to isolate issues
- Focus on one component at a time
