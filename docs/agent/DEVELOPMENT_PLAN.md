# Development Plan

## Primary Goal
Achieve meaningful speech transcription with MAX Graph encoder while maintaining the successful architectural integration.

## Infrastructure Improvements
See [IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md](IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md) for comprehensive project infrastructure improvements including testing, benchmarking, and development experience enhancements.

## Phase 1: Diagnostic Analysis (Current)
**Objective**: Understand why MAX Graph encoder features lack semantic richness

### Tasks
1. **Feature Comparison**
   - Extract and compare encoder outputs from MAX Graph vs OpenAI implementations
   - Analyze numerical differences, attention patterns, and feature distributions
   - Identify where semantic information is lost

2. **Operation Validation**
   - Verify each MAX Graph operation produces expected results
   - Check numerical precision and potential floating-point differences
   - Validate weight loading and tensor conversions

3. **Pipeline Debugging**
   - Isolate encoder vs decoder issues
   - Test with ground-truth encoder features fed to PyTorch decoder
   - Validate mel spectrogram processing

## Phase 2: Semantic Optimization
**Objective**: Improve encoder feature quality for meaningful output

### Potential Approaches
1. **Operation Tuning**
   - Adjust layer normalization parameters
   - Verify attention mechanism implementation
   - Check activation function precision

2. **Weight Integration**
   - Validate weight loading and format conversion
   - Ensure proper initialization and scaling
   - Check for any missing or corrupted weights

3. **Architecture Refinement**
   - Compare MAX Graph operations with reference implementations
   - Implement missing operations if needed
   - Optimize computation order and precision

## Phase 3: Performance Optimization
**Objective**: Maintain fast execution while improving quality

### Future Work
- Kernel fusion optimization
- Memory usage optimization
- End-to-end pipeline performance tuning

## Success Criteria
- [ ] MAX Graph encoder produces semantically meaningful features
- [ ] Decoder generates accurate transcription (not repetitive tokens)
- [ ] Performance remains competitive with GPU version
- [ ] Clean integration without errors

## Risk Mitigation
- Maintain working CPU/GPU implementations as baselines
- Document all changes for potential rollback
- Test incrementally to isolate issues
- Focus on one component at a time
