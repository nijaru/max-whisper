# Semantic Quality Implementation Plan

*Strategic plan for fixing MAX Graph encoder semantic output*

## Problem Statement
MAX Graph encoder executes correctly (~123ms) but produces repetitive tokens instead of meaningful transcription. Technical integration is complete - this is a semantic fidelity issue requiring systematic debugging.

## Three-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Feature Analysis & Comparison (Week 1)
**Goal**: Identify where semantic divergence occurs between MAX Graph and reference implementations

**Deliverables**:
- Encoder feature extraction from all three implementations
- Layer-by-layer numerical comparison
- Identification of divergence point(s)
- Baseline comparison infrastructure

**Success Criteria**: 
- Know exactly which layer/operation causes semantic divergence
- Have quantitative metrics for feature differences
- Reproducible comparison workflow

### Phase 2: Precision Debugging & Fixes (Weeks 2-3)
**Goal**: Fix numerical precision differences to achieve semantic fidelity

**Deliverables**:
- Corrected MAX Graph operations to match reference precision
- Validated attention mechanism fidelity
- Fixed layer normalization and other operations
- Iterative testing with immediate feedback

**Success Criteria**:
- Encoder features match reference implementation within acceptable tolerance
- Beginning to see meaningful tokens instead of repetitive output
- Systematic validation of each fix

### Phase 3: Validation & Optimization (Week 4)
**Goal**: Ensure robust performance across multiple scenarios

**Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive testing across audio samples
- Performance validation (maintain ~123ms advantage)
- Documentation of solutions and lessons learned
- Production-ready implementation

**Success Criteria**:
- Perfect transcription quality matching CPU/GPU implementations
- Maintained performance advantage
- Robust across different audio types and lengths

## Task Management Strategy

### High-Level Task Categories
1. **Infrastructure Tasks**: Set up comparison/debugging tools
2. **Analysis Tasks**: Extract and compare features
3. **Debugging Tasks**: Fix specific precision issues
4. **Validation Tasks**: Test fixes comprehensively
5. **Documentation Tasks**: Capture findings and solutions

### Claude Code Todo Integration
Each phase breaks down into specific todos that can be managed with TodoWrite/TodoRead:

**Phase 1 Example Todos**:
- Set up encoder feature extraction for CPU implementation
- Set up encoder feature extraction for GPU implementation  
- Set up encoder feature extraction for MAX Graph implementation
- Create numerical comparison utilities
- Run full comparison and identify divergence layers

**Phase 2 Example Todos**:
- Fix attention operation precision in layer 1
- Validate attention fix with feature comparison
- Fix layer normalization precision
- Fix matrix multiplication precision
- Test combined fixes end-to-end

**Phase 3 Example Todos**:
- Test on 5 different audio samples
- Validate performance hasn't degraded
- Document all fixes and lessons learned
- Update implementation guide

### Progress Tracking System
- **Daily Progress**: Use PROGRESS_LOG.md for session tracking
- **Active Todos**: Use Claude Code TodoWrite/TodoRead for current work
- **Findings**: Document in DEBUGGING_FINDINGS.md as we discover issues
- **Solutions**: Update TECHNICAL_NOTES.md with successful fixes

### Bug/Issue Management
When bugs or unexpected issues arise:
1. **Document in DEBUGGING_FINDINGS.md**: What happened, what was tried
2. **Create specific todos**: Break down the investigation needed
3. **Update status**: Mark relevant todos as blocked if needed
4. **Iterate**: Adjust plan based on findings

## Debugging Workflow

### Systematic Feature Comparison
1. **Extract Features**: Get encoder output at each layer
2. **Numerical Comparison**: Quantify differences (L2 norm, cosine similarity)
3. **Visualize Differences**: Create plots/analysis of divergence
4. **Isolate Operations**: Test individual operations in isolation
5. **Fix and Validate**: Apply fixes and immediately test

### Validation Criteria
- **Numerical Precision**: Encoder features within 1e-6 tolerance
- **Semantic Quality**: Meaningful transcription output
- **Performance**: Maintain <200ms encoder execution
- **Robustness**: Works across different audio samples

## Risk Management

### Known Risks
1. **Attention Complexity**: Attention mechanisms are intricate
2. **Numerical Stability**: Small differences can compound
3. **MAX Graph Specifics**: May have unique precision characteristics
4. **Performance Trade-offs**: Fixes might affect speed

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with isolated operation testing
- Maintain comprehensive test suite
- Document all changes for easy rollback
- Regular validation against performance benchmarks

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Encoder feature similarity >99% with reference
- Transcription accuracy matches CPU/GPU implementations
- Performance within 150ms total execution time

### Qualitative  
- Meaningful transcription instead of repetitive tokens
- Consistent results across different audio types
- Maintainable and well-documented solution

## Resource Requirements

### Tools (Already Available)
- ✅ Structured logging with JSON output
- ✅ Comprehensive benchmark suite
- ✅ Error handling and retry mechanisms
- ✅ Feature extraction capabilities

### Documentation (Will Create)
- DEBUGGING_FINDINGS.md - Track issues and solutions
- FEATURE_COMPARISON.md - Numerical analysis results
- PRECISION_FIXES.md - Document all fixes applied

## Next Steps

1. **Create supporting documentation** (DEBUGGING_FINDINGS.md, etc.)
2. **Set up Phase 1 todos** in Claude Code
3. **Begin feature extraction** for all three implementations
4. **Establish comparison baseline** with quantitative metrics

This plan provides structure while remaining flexible enough to handle the iterative nature of debugging work.
