# Hackathon Submission Details

**Event**: Modular Hack Weekend  
**Dates**: June 27-29, 2025  
**Project**: Whisper Speech Recognition with MAX Graph

## 🎯 Submission Overview

### Project Goal
Demonstrate Whisper speech recognition using MAX Graph platform, showing progression from CPU baseline through GPU acceleration to MAX Graph implementation.

### Three-Tier Implementation Strategy
1. **whisper_cpu.py** - CPU baseline (reference quality and performance)
2. **whisper_gpu.py** - GPU-accelerated version (production optimization)
3. **whisper_max.py** - MAX Graph implementation (platform demonstration)

## 📊 Expected Demo Flow

### Demonstration Script
```bash
# 1. Show CPU baseline performance
echo "Testing CPU baseline..."
pixi run -e benchmark python src/model/whisper_cpu.py

# 2. Show GPU acceleration improvement  
echo "Testing GPU acceleration..."
pixi run -e benchmark python src/model/whisper_gpu.py

# 3. Show MAX Graph platform capability
echo "Testing MAX Graph implementation..."
pixi run -e default python src/model/whisper_max.py

# 4. Generate comparison table
echo "Running complete benchmark..."
python benchmark_all.py
```

### Expected Results Table
| Implementation | Platform | Time | Speedup | Quality | Purpose |
|---------------|----------|------|---------|---------|---------|
| whisper_cpu | OpenAI CPU | ~10s | 1.0x | Perfect | Baseline |
| whisper_gpu | OpenAI + CUDA | ~3s | 3x | Perfect | Production |
| whisper_max | MAX Graph | ~2s | 5x | Good | Platform Demo |
