# Phase 2 CUDA Library Issue

**Issue**: MAX Graph GPU execution fails with missing CUDA libraries
**Error**: `Failed to load CUDA cuBLAS library from libcublas.so.12`

## Status

- ‚úÖ MAX Graph implementation working on CPU with excellent performance
- ‚úÖ Simplified encoder achieving 14,000-37,000x real-time on CPU
- ‚ö†Ô∏è GPU execution blocked by CUDA library linking issue
- üîç NVIDIA drivers and CUDA 12.9 are installed but libraries not accessible

## CPU Performance Results

```
Average time: 0.80 ¬± 0.29 ms
Min time: 0.56 ms
Audio duration: 30.0 s
Real-time factor: 0.000027
Speedup: 37,636x real-time
‚úÖ Exceeds target RTF of 0.001!
```

## Next Steps

1. **Continue with CPU optimization** - Already exceeding performance targets
2. **Complete full Whisper implementation** - Add decoder and real transcription
3. **Implement Mojo preprocessing** - Further optimize the pipeline
4. **Document CUDA issue** - For hackathon submission context

## Workaround Strategy

Since CPU performance already exceeds our targets by a significant margin:
- Focus on completing the full Whisper model on CPU
- Implement Mojo preprocessing optimizations
- Create compelling demo showing 37,000x speedup
- Document GPU potential for future work
