# Current Status - MAX-Whisper

**Last Updated**: June 28, 2025  
**Time Remaining**: ~24 hours  
**Hardware**: RTX 4090 (24GB) on Fedora

## Executive Summary

We have a working MAX Graph encoder achieving impressive speeds (72,290x), but it's a simplified implementation. For a fair hackathon submission, we need to build a complete model with decoder that produces actual transcriptions.

## What's Working âœ…

### 1. MAX Graph GPU Execution
- Successfully running on RTX 4090
- CUDA libraries properly configured
- Achieving 0.41ms for encoder pass

### 2. Basic Encoder
- Simplified architecture (single linear layer)
- Fixed input size (80Ã—1500)
- Proper tensor operations on GPU

### 3. Infrastructure
- Benchmarking suite operational
- Audio preprocessing pipeline
- Weight loading utilities (ready but not integrated)

## What's Missing ðŸ”´

### 1. Real Architecture
- Current: Single linear layer
- Needed: Multi-head attention, layer norm, positional encoding

### 2. Decoder
- No decoder implementation
- No cross-attention
- No text generation

### 3. Weights & Tokenizer
- Using random weights
- No tokenizer integration
- No actual transcription

### 4. Fair Comparison
- Comparing encoder-only vs full models
- Not apples-to-apples

## Performance Reality Check

### Current Claims
- 72,290x real-time
- 0.41ms for 30s audio
- 1,250x faster than OpenAI

### The Truth
- This is encoder-only (not full model)
- Simplified architecture (not transformer)
- Unfair comparison

### Realistic Expectations
With full model implementation:
- Encoder: ~5-10ms (with proper transformer)
- Decoder: ~10-20ms (with attention)
- Total: ~20-30ms for transcription
- Expected: 30-50x speedup (still impressive!)

## Next 24 Hours Plan

### Priority 1: Real Encoder (6 hrs)
```
[ ] Conv1d input layers
[ ] 4 transformer blocks
[ ] Multi-head attention
[ ] Load encoder weights
```

### Priority 2: Decoder (6 hrs)
```
[ ] Token embeddings
[ ] 4 transformer blocks  
[ ] Cross-attention
[ ] Load embedding weights
```

### Priority 3: Integration (4 hrs)
```
[ ] Tokenizer integration
[ ] Greedy decoding
[ ] End-to-end pipeline
```

### Priority 4: Benchmarking (2 hrs)
```
[ ] Fair comparison
[ ] Document limitations
[ ] Create demo
```

## Success Metrics

### Minimum Success
- Produces some text output (even if poor quality)
- Uses real embedding weights
- Shows speedup on fair comparison

### Target Success  
- Coherent transcriptions
- 20-50x speedup on full pipeline
- Clean implementation

### Stretch Success
- Accurate transcriptions
- Batch processing
- Live demo

## Key Files

### Current Implementation
- `src/model/max_whisper_simple.py` - Oversimplified encoder
- `src/model/whisper_weights.py` - Weight loader (ready)
- `benchmarks/` - Testing infrastructure

### Need to Build
- `src/model/max_whisper_real.py` - Full implementation
- `benchmarks/fair_comparison.py` - Honest benchmarking

## Command Reference

```bash
# Environment setup
source setup_cuda_env.sh

# Current implementation
pixi run -e default python src/model/max_whisper_simple.py

# Benchmarking
pixi run -e default python benchmark_max_only.py

# Development (new model)
pixi run -e default python src/model/max_whisper_real.py
```

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Can't complete full model
- Mitigation: Focus on decoder + embeddings minimum

### Risk: Poor transcription quality
- Mitigation: Document as proof-of-concept

### Risk: Lower speedup with full model
- Mitigation: Still impressive if 20-30x

## Bottom Line

We need to pivot from claiming extreme speeds on a toy model to building something real that transcribes. Even 20x speedup on actual transcription would be a significant achievement worthy of the hackathon.
