## Risk Mitigation Checkpoints

### Friday Night Decision Points
- **If Mojo too complex**: Focus on MAX Graph, use Python preprocessing
- **If environment issues**: Switch to CPU development, optimize later
- **If behind schedule**: Reduce scope to encoder-only implementation

### Saturday Evening Decision Points  
- **If decoder too complex**: Focus on encoder efficiency, feature extraction
- **If accuracy issues**: Document trade-offs, emphasize speed gains
- **If performance poor**: Identify bottlenecks, focus optimization efforts

### Sunday Morning Decision Points
- **If optimization insufficient**: Emphasize architecture benefits, potential gains
- **If demo not working**: Use benchmark results, static comparison
- **If major bugs**: Roll back to last working version, polish presentation
