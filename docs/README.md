## Quick Reference

**What Works 100%:**
- MAX Graph environment setup and compilation
- Weight extraction (65 tensors from Whisper tiny)
- Core MAX Graph operations (ops.matmul, ops.layer_norm, etc.)
- Cross-framework integration (MAX Graph â†’ PyTorch)
- CPU and GPU baseline implementations

**What's Challenging:**
- Semantic quality of MAX Graph encoder features
- Meaningful speech recognition (currently repetitive tokens)

**Performance:**
- CPU: ~3.5s (perfect quality)
- GPU: ~1.0s (perfect quality, 3.5x speedup)
- MAX Graph: ~1.3s (123ms encoder, pipeline works, quality tuning needed)
