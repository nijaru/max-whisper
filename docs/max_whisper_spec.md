# MAX-Whisper: High-Performance Speech Transcription

## Project Overview

Build an optimized Whisper implementation using Mojo and MAX Graph that demonstrates significant performance improvements over standard implementations. Target deployment on resource-constrained hardware while maintaining transcription quality.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Audio Preprocessing Pipeline** (Mojo)
   - Mel-spectrogram computation
   - Audio normalization and windowing
   - Batch processing optimization

2. **Whisper Model Implementation** (MAX Graph)
   - Encoder transformer stack
   - Decoder with attention mechanism
   - Optimized for inference (no training)

3. **Performance Benchmarking Suite**
   - Automated testing framework
   - Memory usage tracking
   - Latency measurements
   - Accuracy validation

4. **Demo Application**
   - Simple web interface or CLI
   - Real-time audio processing
   - Side-by-side performance comparison

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Friday Evening)
- Set up MAX Graph environment
- Implement basic audio preprocessing in Mojo
- Load pre-trained Whisper weights
- Establish baseline measurements

### Phase 2: Core Model (Saturday)
- Implement Whisper encoder in MAX Graph
- Build decoder with attention mechanism
- Integration testing with audio pipeline
- Initial performance benchmarking

### Phase 3: Optimization (Sunday Morning)
- Memory usage optimization
- Batch processing improvements
- GPU utilization tuning
- Performance profiling

### Phase 4: Demo & Documentation (Sunday Afternoon)
- Build demonstration interface
- Generate comprehensive benchmarks
- Create forum post and documentation
- Final testing and validation

## Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
- **Speed**: 2-3x faster than OpenAI Whisper
- **Memory**: 40-50% reduction in peak memory usage
- **Accuracy**: <5% degradation in WER (Word Error Rate)
- **Hardware**: Runs efficiently on 4GB GPU

### Comparison Targets
1. OpenAI Whisper (baseline)
2. Faster-Whisper (current best practice)
3. MAX-Whisper (your implementation)

### Documentation Requirements
- Performance comparison report
- Implementation details and optimizations
- Setup and deployment guide
- Modular forum post with results

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
- **MAX Graph learning curve** → Start with simple encoder-only version
- **Weight loading complexity** → Use existing conversion tools
- **Integration challenges** → Build incrementally with testing

### Fallback Plans
- If full Whisper too complex → Focus on encoder + feature extraction
- If real-time demo fails → Batch processing demonstration
- If accuracy issues → Document trade-offs, focus on speed gains

## Marketing Narrative

**"From Research to Production: Making Enterprise Speech Recognition Accessible"**

- Demonstrate how MAX Graph enables practical deployment
- Show clear path from expensive cloud APIs to edge computing
- Quantify cost savings and performance improvements
- Position as enabler for real-world applications

## Timeline Checkpoints

- **Friday 10PM**: Audio preprocessing working, MAX Graph environment set up
- **Saturday 6PM**: Basic Whisper model running, initial benchmarks complete
- **Sunday 2PM**: Optimizations complete, demo ready, documentation started
- **Sunday 6PM**: Final submission with comprehensive results
