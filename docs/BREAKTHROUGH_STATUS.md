# Platform fix
platforms = ["linux-64"]  # Removed osx-arm64

# Environment setup
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PIXI_ENV/cublas/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

### Verification Commands
```bash
# CUDA setup
source setup_cuda_env.sh

# Test complete system
pixi run -e default python src/model/max_whisper_complete.py
