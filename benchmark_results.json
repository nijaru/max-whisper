With support for portability across these GPUs, Max is truly the easiest and most performed way to run inference on your models. In this demo, we'll deploy the Max container in order to create a couple of different serving endpoints. First, you'll want to pull down the Max Stocker container from our public Docker hub. We provide a single unified container that contains all the core dependencies needed to run in a hardware-agnostic manner. Let's start with the NVIDIA.
