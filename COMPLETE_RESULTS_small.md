## Analysis

**Fastest**: MAX Graph Fast - 1.70s (6.5x speedup)

**GPU Acceleration**: 6.0x speedup over CPU baseline

**MAX Graph Status**: 3.7x speedup but generates plausible text instead of transcribing audio

## Key Findings

- **CPU Baseline**: Pure OpenAI Whisper provides perfect transcription (reference implementation)
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA provides significant speedup with identical transcription quality
- **MAX Graph**: Demonstrates platform tensor operations but generates text instead of speech recognition
- **Quality vs Speed**: GPU acceleration provides best balance of speed and accuracy
- **Platform Demo**: MAX Graph shows platform capability but needs development for speech recognition

## Recommendations

**For Production Speech Recognition**: Use GPU-accelerated implementation for optimal speed and quality  
**For Platform Demonstration**: MAX Graph implementation shows tensor processing capabilities  
**For Development**: CPU baseline provides guaranteed compatibility and reference quality
