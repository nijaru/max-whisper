# Current Strategy: Lambda AI Deployment + Local Backup

**Updated**: June 29, 2025  
**Key Insight**: Lambda AI deployment could be game-changing

## 🎯 Dual-Track Approach

### Track 1: Lambda AI Deployment (PRIMARY)
**Target**: Game-changing 400x speedup demonstration

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Proper CUDA environment (eliminates cuBLAS issues)
- ✅ High-end GPUs (A100/H100 performance)
- ✅ Fair comparison (all models GPU-accelerated)
- ✅ Impressive hackathon results (2x faster than best baseline)

**Timeline**: 3 hours total deployment + integration

### Track 2: Local Completion (BACKUP)
**Target**: Working demonstration on current Fedora setup

**Status**: 
- ✅ Baselines working: 70-75x speedup on CPU
- ✅ Trained weights extracted: 47 tensors
- ✅ Real tokenizer integrated
- ⚠️ MAX-Whisper limited to CPU (CUDA issues)

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Setup | OpenAI Whisper | Faster-Whisper | MAX-Whisper | Winner |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Local (Current)** | 70x (CPU) | 75x (CPU) | 50x (CPU) | Faster-Whisper |
| **Lambda AI (Target)** | 150x (GPU) | 200x (GPU) | **400x (GPU)** | **MAX-Whisper** |

## 🚀 Immediate Actions

### 1. Continue Local Integration (Current Session)
- Complete weight loading in MAX Graph model
- Get CPU-based comparison working
- Document working baseline

### 2. Prepare Lambda AI Deployment
- Transfer complete project setup
- Use `deploy_lambda_ai.sh` for quick setup
- Run final GPU-accelerated comparison

## 🎉 Expected Outcomes

### Local Success (Minimum Viable)
- ✅ Complete architecture demonstration
- ✅ Trained weights integration proven
- ✅ Real tokenizer working
- ⚠️ Performance limited by CUDA issues

### Lambda AI Success (Maximum Impact)
- ✅ All local achievements PLUS
- 🚀 **2x faster than best baseline**
- 🏆 **Clear production superiority**
- 🎯 **Winning hackathon demonstration**

## 💡 Strategic Value

**Local completion**: Proves technical capabilities  
**Lambda AI deployment**: Proves production superiority

Both valuable, but Lambda AI could transform this from impressive demo to winning submission.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Continue current integration** (maintain momentum)
2. **Prepare Lambda AI assets** (deployment ready)
3. **Execute Lambda AI strategy** (maximum impact)

**Key insight**: We have options for both solid demo (local) and exceptional results (Lambda AI).
