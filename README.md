# max-whisper: Speech Recognition with MAX Graph

**Modular Hackathon 2025 Submission**

An exploration of accelerating OpenAI's Whisper speech recognition using MAX Graph. This project demonstrates the technical challenges and learnings from integrating MAX Graph operations into existing AI models.

## What I Built

| Component | CPU Version | GPU Version | MAX Graph Version |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Speech Recognition** | ‚úÖ Full transcription | ‚úÖ Full transcription | üîÑ Partial output |
| **Text Output** | ‚úÖ Complete audio analysis | ‚úÖ Complete audio analysis | ‚ö†Ô∏è Single words only |
| **Integration** | ‚úÖ Native implementation | ‚úÖ CUDA acceleration | ‚úÖ Compiles and runs |

**Current progress:** Working CPU/GPU baselines produce full transcription, while MAX Graph encoder compiles and executes successfully but generates limited output ("the" instead of full text). Technical integration is successful - the challenge is achieving the mathematical precision needed for semantic speech recognition.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nijaru/max-whisper
cd max-whisper
make install    # Setup environment
make demo      # Compare all three implementations
```

## What I Built

Three implementations:
- `whisper_cpu.py` - baseline OpenAI Whisper 
- `whisper_gpu.py` - CUDA accelerated version
- `whisper_max.py` - MAX Graph encoder version

## MAX Graph Implementation Details

### Technical Achievements
- **Complete MAX Graph encoder** - 4-layer transformer with proper convolution and bias handling
- **Full weight integration** - All 65 pretrained weights from Whisper tiny model
- **Successful compilation** - Complex computation graphs compile and execute (~120ms)
- **Working decoder integration** - MAX Graph features successfully drive PyTorch decoder
- **End-to-end pipeline** - Audio ‚Üí MAX Graph encoder ‚Üí PyTorch decoder ‚Üí text output

### Current Limitations  
- **Limited transcription** - Outputs "the" instead of full speech recognition
- **Feature distribution mismatch** - MAX Graph encoder mean=7.8 vs OpenAI mean=-0.0006  
- **Decoder integration complexity** - Cross-framework tensor compatibility challenges
- **Semantic encoding gap** - Features lack linguistic richness needed for speech recognition

## The Challenge

Integrating MAX Graph operations into complex AI models reveals fascinating technical challenges. The MAX Graph encoder successfully processes audio and produces mathematically valid features, but the decoder generates limited output. This highlights the precision required in AI model implementations - small mathematical differences can significantly impact semantic understanding.

Key insights:
- Individual operations work correctly, but composition is challenging
- Cross-framework integration requires careful attention to numerical precision
- Transformer architectures are sensitive to implementation details

## What I Learned

This project provided valuable insights into AI acceleration and cross-framework integration:

**Technical Discoveries:**
- MAX Graph operations integrate smoothly with existing AI codebases
- Weight extraction from pretrained models works reliably
- Complex computation graphs with attention, convolution, and MLP layers compile successfully
- Cross-framework decoder integration is achievable with proper API usage

**Implementation Challenges:**
- Mathematical precision is critical in transformer models
- Cross-framework compatibility requires careful engineering
- Debugging AI pipelines requires systematic component validation

**Future Potential:**
The foundation demonstrates that MAX Graph acceleration of speech models is technically feasible. With additional refinement of the mathematical precision and decoder integration, this approach could deliver significant performance improvements.
