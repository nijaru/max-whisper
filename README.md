# max-whisper: Speech Recognition with MAX Graph

A technical exploration of integrating MAX Graph operations into OpenAI's Whisper speech recognition model. This project demonstrates real MAX Graph compilation, execution, and cross-framework integration with detailed analysis of implementation approaches.

## Project Status

| Implementation | Status | Performance | Quality | Technical Details |
|---------------|--------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| **CPU Baseline** | ✅ Working | ~10.6s | Perfect transcription | OpenAI Whisper reference |
| **GPU Accelerated** | ✅ Working | ~1.9s (5.7x faster) | Perfect transcription | CUDA acceleration |
| **MAX Graph** | ⚠️ Architecture complete | ~0.24s encoder only | Incorrect output | Technical integration successful, semantic output needs work |

**Current Status:** The MAX Graph implementation demonstrates successful architectural integration - all components compile and execute without errors. However, the encoder produces repetitive tokens rather than meaningful transcription, indicating the need for further semantic optimization work.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nijaru/max-whisper
cd max-whisper
make install                           # Setup pixi environment
pixi run -e benchmark demo             # Compare all implementations (enhanced UI)
pixi run -e benchmark test-cpu         # Test CPU baseline only
pixi run -e benchmark test-gpu         # Test GPU version only
pixi run -e benchmark test-max         # Test MAX Graph version only
```

### New Enhanced Commands
```bash
pixi run -e benchmark benchmark        # Structured benchmark with error handling
pixi run -e benchmark benchmark-json   # JSON output for parsing/analysis
pixi run test                          # Run comprehensive test suite
```

## MAX Graph Implementation Details

### ✅ **Technical Integration Achievements**

**Environment & Compilation:**
- MAX Graph imports, device setup (GPU/CPU), and graph compilation function correctly
- Environment dependencies resolve without issues

**Weight Extraction:**
- Successfully extracts all 65 pretrained weights from Whisper tiny model
- Maintains correct tensor shapes and data integrity
- Integrates cleanly with MAX Graph tensor format

**MAX Graph Operations:**
```python
# These operations execute successfully:
ops.matmul(a, b)           # Matrix multiplication 
ops.transpose(x, 0, 1)     # Tensor transpose
ops.layer_norm(x, ...)     # Layer normalization
ops.gelu(x)                # GELU activation
ops.slice_tensor(x, [...]) # Tensor slicing
```

**Cross-Framework Pipeline:**
- MAX Graph encoder → PyTorch decoder integration works without errors
- Proper tensor conversions and device management
- Encoder executes in ~123ms on GPU

### ⚠️ **Current Limitations**

**Output Quality:**
- Encoder produces repetitive tokens (e.g., `<|ml|>`) instead of meaningful transcription
- While mathematically valid, features lack the semantic richness needed for speech recognition
- The technical pipeline functions correctly, but output quality requires significant improvement

**Next Steps:**
Further work is needed to bridge the gap between technical execution and semantic understanding in the encoder features.

## Key Technical Insights

**What This Project Demonstrates:**
- MAX Graph can successfully integrate with complex AI architectures (4-layer transformer with attention)
- Cross-framework integration (MAX Graph → PyTorch) is technically feasible
- Weight extraction and integration from pretrained models functions correctly
- Compilation and execution performance shows promise (~123ms encoder)

**Current Challenge:**
This project highlights the complexity of AI model acceleration beyond basic technical integration. While the architectural components work correctly, producing semantically meaningful output requires careful attention to feature representation and model fidelity.

**Learning Outcome:**
Successfully implementing AI acceleration involves both technical integration (achieved) and semantic preservation (ongoing work needed).
